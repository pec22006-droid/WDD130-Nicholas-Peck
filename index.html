            Hi everyone! I'm Nicholas Peck, and I am a big fan of programming. 
            I am majoring in computer science, and I would eventually like to get a job in software development of some sort. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My favorite things to do are play games, (game of all sorts: board games, card games, video games, sports games), I also like to program, and I like math. I also like to sing and play piano. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently living with my parents and one brother. I recently got home from serving a mission in La Serena, Chile.

            I am excited to get to know all of you in this class!
