        Welcome to Speedy Peck's guide to Minecraft Speedrunning! Here you will learn about
        the tips and tricks you will need to be able to complete your first speedrun on a random seed
        on Java edition. Individual speeds may vary, but this should be everything you need to know 
        in order to achieve a sub-40 minute run. 
        <br>
        Some tips and tricks: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Use version 1.16.1: they changed a lot about piglin trading and bastion remnants. 
                It will make your life much easier to play on this version.</li>
            <li>Change your gamma to 5. It is completely speedrun legal, and it 
                makes it so that you can see underwater and in caves. This can be done by opening your 
                .minecraft folder which by default can be found with windows key + R, and %appdata%/.minecraft
                on Windows or on Linux and Mac it can be found in your home folder</li>
            <li>Use your sprint hotkey (by default Ctrl) to sprint rather than double tapping 'W'.</li>
            <li>Use some hotkeys for your hotbar. Scrolling around is easier, but if you get 
                used to using your hotkeys to navagate your hotbar, you can go much faster. 
                (also, you should probably change at least the last three slots to something 
                closer to your hand than 7, 8, and 9.)</li>
        </ul>
        A quick note before you start: <br>
        Minecraft speedrunning is HARD. You will fail a lot, and you will die a lot (in game, not in real 
        life.) You will need patience, as you would when developing any other skill. The best runners 
        have spent thousands of hours perfecting their craft. Don't expect to be an expert overnight. 
        Don't expect to be an expert after just reading this. You will need some practice. without it
        you won't make much progress.

      <h3>The Overworld</h3>
      <p>
        So, just starting out, what do we need before we go to the Nether? The answer is surprisingly
        not a lot! The short answer is we need 7 iron for a pickaxe, a bucket and a flint and steel, 
        (don't forget the gravel to get the flint!) and we also need a bit of food. You can do this by 
        going into caves to mine iron, and killing a few animals for food, however we will be covering
        how to use structures to make this easier and faster. <br>
        The first structure we will cover is villages. They vary in quality, but in almost all plains,
        desert, and savanna villages you can find a large quantity of hay bales. This can be your 
        source of food, as well as a source of emeralds. Why would we want emeralds? for a strategy 
        called "cod strats". It includes getting 3 emeralds, usually from trading wheat to a farmer 
        villager (you can ensure a level 1 trade by destroying and replacing the composter until he 
        gives you the desired trade.) After obtaining the three emeralds, you can trade them with a 
        fisherman for a bucket of cod. This functions as the bucket, and the rest of the iron can be
        obtained by killing the iron golem. This can be done by pillaring up three blocks. He can't 
        reach you from there. Alternatively, if you have a shovel, you can dig down two blocks. <br>
        It is also very useful to know what houses to check for loot. For beginners, I recommend taking
        a bed or two as they will help us out in the last step. Other than that, the most important loot
        can be found in the blacksmith house. This is the one with lava. It also has either cobblestone
        or diorite. The chest there can contain iron or diamonds, potentially also a pickaxe or obsidian
        all useful things to have. <br>
        The second structure we will cover is the desert temple. Here, all you have to do is get in,
        go to the central section, and mine down on one of the blocks next to the center block, and 
        mine the block under the pressure plate. You can then mine the TNT, pillar out of the small 
        hole with a TNT, then light one, as shown in the picture, and jump back into the hole. This
        is the fastest way to loot all of the chests, and it also gets you some cobblestone to make 
        the rest of your tools out of. This is usually enough to get you enough blocks for your run,
        and your seven iron, and a bunch of rotten flesh that can be used as food, as well as often
        a golden apple to eat in case things ever get dicey.<br>
        The last structure we will cover are shipwrecks. There are three chests in shipwrecks. In the
        back there is a valuables chest. This will almost always have your seven iron, and enough extra 
        iron, gold, or diamonds to make the rest of your tools. On the lower layer there are two chests.
        In the back, below the valuables chest is a chest that has a buried treasure map. We will not 
        worry about this. It can be useful if the valuables chest doesn't have enough iron to make everything
        you need. In the front you can find the food chest. grab all of the wheat and carrots and suspicious
        stew from there. After looting everything, you can craft all of your tools, and the wheat into bread
        From there, it's usually recommended that you enter the nether through a magma ravine.<br>
        Now that you have your iron and food from your desired method, we've got to enter the nether. This
        can be done by using the mechanic that lava placed next to water will turn into obsidian. The two 
        videos below show you how to make the portals, each one has one slow and one fast example. <br>
        A couple of notes about each one: for the surface lava version, you need to make sure that you
        start in the middle of a line of four lava. For the magma ravine version, you need to make sure 
        have a setup like I do in the video with an "L" of magma. If you don't have obsidian on the sides, 
        you will need to place lava there to complete the portal. Follow the video, then if you have any 
        excess magma in the portal frame, you can get s bit of lava with your bucket, then mine it, and 
        place the lava, then grab some water, and place it on the top of the inside of the frame

      <h3>The Nether</h3>
      <p>
        So, you've made it to the nether. Now what? Now you need two things: ender pearls, and blaze
        rods. By far the easiest way to get ender pearls in verision 1.16.1 is by finding a bastion, 
        and bartering with the piglins. The reason you want this version, is because in version 1.16.2,
        they changed the rates, and you get on average about 4 times fewer pearls from bartering. <br>
        So, how do you even find a bastion? Well, you could wander around aimlessly to find one, but 
        that could take a while. The trick you need is called E-ray. What you do, is you lower your FOV. <br>
        FOV stands for field of view. With a lower number, it's like zooming in the camera that you can 
        imagine is placed at your eyes so that you can see. Now, press <br><br>
        Yeah... That's a lot of information, but up there close to the top left at about the 5th line 
        it has the letter E and then two numbers divided by a slash. The second one of those numbers is 
        the number of entities (mobs, items, etc.) that are loaded in. The first number is how many of 
        those are in your field of view, even counting ones that you can't see because they are 
        through blocks. <br>
        Now, the important part: bastions generate with their mobs. If the second number is significantly
        more than 100 (something in the range of 130 to 180 usually) you have a bastion loaded. If you 
        don't have a numeber that high, increase your render distance to at least 20 (the higher, the
        better) and wait a bit for a bastion to load in. Then, with your FOV lowered to 30, look around, 
        and find where the first number spikes up to at least 30. If you get no "spike" in any direction,
        try increasing your entity distance to 500% (this one is also in the same page as render distance)
        and if you still don't see a spike, increase your render distance by about 2, and you should be 
        able to find a spike. <br>
        Now that you have the spike, you just need to go in that direction, and like magic, there's 
        a bastion!<br>
        Now that you're at the bastion, how do you properly get all of the gold to be able to barter
        with the piglins? Well in order to know that, we've got to know a little bit about bastions. <br>
        There are four types of bastions: Bridge, Stables, Treasure, and Housing. Each one has a slightly
        different way that you need to get all of the gold. I will be showing where the gold and showing 
        one beginner route to be able to trade the gold with the piglins for each bastion type.
